      ⚠️  To have superior experience, enable autocompletion on Brew. ⚠️
      You need to enable autocompletion just once for Brew. If it is already enabled, you can skip this part.
      ▪ For Zsh users:
        Follow https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion#configuring-completions-in-zsh
      ▪ For Bash users:
        1) `brew install bash-completion` and follow the printed \"Caveats\" section. Example \"Caveats\" instructions:
           Add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:
           # !! Note that paths may differ depending on your installation, so you should follow the Caveats section on your system.
           [[ -r \"/Users/anton/.brew/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\" ]] && . \"/home/anton/.brew/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\"
        2) `source ~/.bash_profile`
